Hello my name is Chuck you can think of me as chuckflaska89@gmail.com and im a DIY developer with a focus on the chromium developer state of the offical chromebook.
Virtualization is soon to make chromeos and chromebooks. I do alot of work sure to suite gamers but my main abitions are to possibly learn skills that could lead to 
employment and overall help chromebook dominate their competition. In my opinion they solve large problems like boot time and network utilization and functionality
and optimal user experience potentially on some very very light hardware in the range everyone can afford so my work surrounds doing about everything i need to do on
that systom. Samsung agressive security that stumps those behind Magisk is another intrest of mine so some project will be surrouning Android and Arc su access
though galaxy security is quite fickle and the days of customization might be gone or left to greater minds lol, i will try. Im intrested in projects
like Three.Js CHromebrew and Gentoo Linux but am more focused on ways to improve the actual visual and performance experience of chromebooks chromium and
and chromeos if theres projects you think may be evading me or if you want to understand more about how i figured out to do some things email me at chuckflaska89@gmail.com.
I have spent quite a bit of time that i can easily catch people up on but also an refining my overall traditional knowleghe of the codes that realate for example
i wouldnt be suprised if the first linux kernel i actually upstreamed was say a chromeos update that hasnt been upstreamed but for now i guees it cant be done ;).
